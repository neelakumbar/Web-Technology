    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A warm thanks to the Tap Academy team.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Gowtham GM from Tamilnadu, a 2024 passed-out student. I joined Tap Academy as a CSR student in the month of February.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My journey with Tap Academy is quite different. The trainers at Tap Academy are skilled and experienced. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They teach a lot of new concepts and help in learning programming languages from scratch.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am from the Computer Science branch, but the teaching at Tap Academy is structured in a way that makes it easy for students <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from all domains to understand the concepts and technology taught by the trainers.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I got placed as a Software Engineer at Revature with a package of 3.25 LPA. The placement team helped me a lot in securing this job.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you to the entire Tap Academy team for helping me acquire this opportunity.</pre><br><br><br>
